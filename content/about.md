Hey, I'm Leandro! I am an Offensive Security Specialist, and spend my days hunting down security flaws, tinkering with code, and figuring out how systems can break (so we can fix them before anyone else does).

I've collected a few certifications along the way (**OSCE3, OSWE, OSED, OSEP, OSCP, OSWP, CRTP, GCIH**, etc.), and a CVE([**CVE-2025-28168**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-28168)). 

I actually started in software engineering, so I know my way around development, and architecture before diving headfirst into security.

When I'm not doing work related stuff, you'll probably find me doing some **CTFs**, or just being a normal human being for a while.

Outside of tech, I'm a **nature lover** - whether it's hiking, exploring, or just enjoying the outdoors.

Hope you guys like all my yapping, and remember: stay curious, keep learning, and never stop breaking things 😄
